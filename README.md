# Bike-Sales-Dashboard-Excel

 I executed this project. Presenting the results of the actual bike sales dataset was performed through a very lively dashboard developed in Excel. This project has helped me follow the trend and performance of bike sales, from data processing to data visualization and insight generation, step by step. The Excel dashboard has an intuitive interface that makes navigation easy. This can further translate the data to be an invaluable tool for any decision-maker or stakeholder in the industry of bike sales.
